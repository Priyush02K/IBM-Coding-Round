You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer value.

In one operation, you can add or subtract value from any element of nums.

For example, if nums = [1,2,3] and value = 2, you can choose to subtract value from nums[0] to make nums = [-1,2,3].
The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest missing non-negative integer in it.

For example, the MEX of [-1,2,3] is 0 while the MEX of [1,0,3] is 2.
Return the maximum MEX of nums after applying the mentioned operation any number of times.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,-10,7,13,6,8], value = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: One can achieve this result by applying the following operations:
- Add value to nums[1] twice to make nums = [1,0,7,13,6,8]
- Subtract value from nums[2] once to make nums = [1,0,2,13,6,8]
- Subtract value from nums[3] twice to make nums = [1,0,2,3,6,8]
The MEX of nums is 4. It can be shown that 4 is the maximum MEX we can achieve.

```
class Solution {
  
    // Method to find the smallest integer that is not present in the array when modulus with value
    public int findSmallestInteger(int[] nums, int value) {
        // Create an array to count occurrences of each modulus result
        int[] countModulo = new int[value];
      
        // Iterate over each number in nums and increment the count for the corresponding modulus
        for (int num : nums) {
            countModulo[(num % value + value) % value]++;
        }
      
        // Start looking for the smallest integer that is not in the array, by checking modulus occurrences
        for (int i = 0; ; ++i) { // no termination condition here since we are guaranteed to find a number eventually
            // Use the i % value to wrap around the countModulo array
            // Check if the current number has a count of zero, which means it's not present in the nums array when modulus with value
            if (countModulo[i % value] == 0) {
                // If it's not present, this is the smallest number we are looking for
                return i;
            }
            // Otherwise, decrease the count and keep looking
            countModulo[i % value]--;
        }
    }
}
```
