You are given a 0-indexed binary string target of length n. You have another binary string s of length n that is initially set to all zeros. You want to make s equal to target.

In one operation, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < n and flip all bits in the inclusive range [i, n - 1]. Flip means changing '0' to '1' and '1' to '0'.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make s equal to target.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = "10111"
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, s = "00000".
Choose index i = 2: "00000" -> "00111"
Choose index i = 0: "00111" -> "11000"
Choose index i = 1: "11000" -> "10111"
We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.


```
class Solution {
  public int minFlips(String target) {
    int ans = 0;
    int state = 0;

    for (final char c : target.toCharArray())
      if (c - '0' != state) {
        state = c - '0';
        ++ans;
      }

    return ans;
  }
}
```
